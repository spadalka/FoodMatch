Welcome! This project was created with the help of the Ionic framework.

To give this app a go:
- Make sure you have the latest version of Node
- Install the dependencies with ```npm install```
- Run ```ionic serve```
- Once the window with the app opens up, use ```Option + âŒ˜ + J ``` (on macOS), or ```Shift + CTRL + J``` (on Windows/Linux) to open up Chrome Developer Tools
- In the top left hand corner click on the second icon
